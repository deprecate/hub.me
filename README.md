hub.me #ftw
==================================================

Let me guess!

1. You're a lazy programmer.
2. You have a lot of cool projects here at Github.
3. You want to show the world all your open source stuff.

am I right? So guess what, I have the perfect thing to you.

Let me introduce you hub.me, an alternative and responsive gallery to display all your projects on Github.

Why?
---------------

Discover it reading the history of my friend Clark Kent [here](https://gist.github.com/1385423). Portuguese version [here](https://gist.github.com/1385464).


Getting Started
---------------

### Step 1:

Just fork this repository.

### Step 2:
Then you must change the repository name to `yourUsername.github.com`.

### Step 3:
Now you have to open the `index.html` and put your username on it.

    <script>
		$('body').hubMe({'username': 'yourUsername'});
	</script>

Easy, huh?

*Just remember that may take up to 10 minutes to Github activate pages for your account.

Themes
---------------

If you want another appearance just change the class of the html tag.

	<html class="blue">

For now you have 3 choices to customize it:

* blue (default)
* gray
* black

And, of course, you can create your own theme and then send to us :)
